    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This lamb chop recipe is a family favorite. We've been making it for years for special family occasions.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li?
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary</li?
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano</li?
      <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li?
      <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li?
      <li>12 raw chop with refuse, 160 g; yields excluding refuses lamb chops</li?
      <li>½ cup olive oil</li?
      <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li?
      <li>leaves from 1 celery stalk, chopped</li?
      <li>2 tablespoons salt</li?
      <li>1 cup water, or as needed</li?
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Combine basil, rosemary, oregano, garlic powder, and pepper in a bowl. Season one side of the lamb chops with 1/2 of the seasoning mixture.</li>
      <li>Heat olive oil in a large, deep frying pan over medium-high heat.</li>
      <li>Place each chop, seasoned-sides down, into the heated pan. Season the second side of the lamb chops with the remaining spice mix. Brown both sides quickly, 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce the temperature to medium and add onions. Cook and stir until onions sweat and start to turn translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add celery leaves and salt, and enough water to just cover the chops. Let simmer and reduce over medium heat until water has evaporated, 20 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a chop should read at least 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Serve family-style on a platter using the remaining reduction as a sauce. Sprinkle parsley on top.</li>
    </ol>
