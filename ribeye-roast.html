    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I make this every time rib eyes are on sale. Easy and delicious; there are never any leftovers! We usually cook ours medium-rare!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup softened butter</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 (4 pound) bone-in rib-eye roast</li>
      <li>sea salt to taste</li>
      <li>cracked black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat an oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Beat butter and garlic together in a bowl. Poke several holes in roast with a sharp knife. Rub butter mixture all over roast and season meat with salt and black pepper. Place roast, fat-side up, in a roasting pan.</li>
      <li>Roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C), and continue cooking until roast is reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
